# Spelltome: Origins
This is a full stack web app created for my Ada Developers Academy Cohort 17 capstone project. 

Spelltome is social media for wizards and other arcane magic users inspired by the early online roleplaying spaces known as MUDs and MUSHs. It takes an experimental approach to identity and persistence akin to roguelike/roguelite RPGs by allowing the souls of ancient wizards to take on a life of their own, evoked client-side by any player with their name. 

Spelltome uses an RTE based on Metaâ€™s open source lexical framework to a handle a whole host of content-types to better support wizards in the casting and research of their often multi-faceted spells and rituals.
